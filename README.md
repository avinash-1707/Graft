# Graft

**AI-first customer support you embed with one script tag — and a human takes over the moment it matters.**

Graft is a multi-tenant SaaS support platform. A business drops a single embeddable
chat widget onto its website; its customers talk to an AI assistant that answers **only**
from that business's own knowledge base. When the AI can't help — or a human agent
decides to step in — the same conversation hands off to a real person, live, without the
customer ever seeing a technical seam.

## What Graft does

Most support tools force a choice: a chatbot that hallucinates and frustrates customers,
or a human inbox that's slow and expensive. Graft does both in one conversation and
switches between them automatically.

- **Grounded answers, not guesses.** The AI answers _from_ the tenant's uploaded
  knowledge base in its own words, and declines rather than fabricate when it has nothing
  relevant.
- **One seamless conversation.** AI and human share the same thread, history, and window.
  The handoff is invisible to the customer — they only ever see "You are now talking to a
  human agent" / "…an AI agent".
- **Strict tenant isolation.** Every knowledge base, conversation, and API key is scoped
  to one organization. Nothing is shared across tenants, and the AI runs on the tenant's
  own provider key.

## How it works

### Setting up an organization

A business signs up and becomes the _owner_. The owner connects an AI provider by pasting
their own OpenAI or Anthropic key (Graft encrypts it and never exposes it again), uploads
knowledge as PDF, DOCX, or plain text, customizes the widget, configures when the AI
should escalate to a human, and invites support agents. Finally they embed one line of
HTML on their site — no backend changes required.

### Talking to a customer

A customer opens the chat bubble with no login. The AI answers in natural language,
grounded strictly in the business's material; if it doesn't know, it says so. When a
question needs a human, the conversation quietly switches to a live agent and back again
when the agent is done. Returning in the same browser resumes the full history.

### Working as an agent

An agent sees a live feed of every active conversation in the org, including ones the AI
has flagged for help. They can watch an AI↔customer chat in real time and **claim** it to
take over — claiming is atomic, so if two agents click at once exactly one wins. The agent
chats live, can leave internal notes (never shown to the customer or the AI), then hands
back or closes.

## Architecture

Graft is a TypeScript monorepo of independently deployable services that share typed
contracts, schema, and infrastructure libraries.

```

PostgreSQL is the only source of truth. Redis is ephemeral — Pub/Sub fan-out and BullMQ
queues only. Knowledge-base blobs stage in S3/MinIO and are deleted after ingestion.

The gateway owns authentication and org configuration. The realtime and ingestion services
are reached **directly** by clients (behind the Nginx load balancer in the ops stack), not
proxied through the gateway, so SSE/WebSocket streams and large uploads stay off the auth
hot path. Every service verifies the same gateway-issued JWT against the shared JWKS, so
there is no shared secret. (The gateway's `/v1/*` proxy route is a reserved stub.)

## Conversation lifecycle

```
AI_ACTIVE ──(trigger fires OR agent takeover)──▶ ESCALATION_PENDING
ESCALATION_PENDING ──(atomic claim)──▶ AGENT_ASSIGNED ──▶ HUMAN_ACTIVE
HUMAN_ACTIVE ──(handback)──▶ AI_ACTIVE ──(resolved)──▶ CLOSED
```

Exactly one responder controls a conversation at any time, and transport follows state:
SSE while the AI controls it, WebSocket while a human does. Every message carries a
per-conversation monotonic sequence number; on any reconnect or SSE↔WebSocket switch the
client sends its last-seen sequence and the server replays anything newer, so no message
is lost or duplicated across the switch.

## Escalation

Escalation is evaluated in ai-service per turn. Each trigger is independently toggleable
per tenant:

- **`WEAK_GROUNDING`** (primary) — top retrieved similarity below the tenant threshold.
- **`MODEL_INVOKED`** — the model called the `escalate` tool.
- **`PROVIDER_FAILURE`** — a provider call failed after bounded retries.
- **`THIRD_HUMAN_REQUEST`** — the customer asked for a human N times (default 3).
- **`NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT`** — the turn classifier reports negative sentiment (off by default).

When several fire, priority is `PROVIDER_FAILURE > THIRD_HUMAN_REQUEST > WEAK_GROUNDING >
MODEL_INVOKED > NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT`. The transition is an atomic compare-and-set.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node ≥ 22 and pnpm 10.33.2 (`corepack enable`).
- PostgreSQL 18 + pgvector 0.8.2, Redis, and an S3-compatible store (MinIO) — or use the
  Docker stack in `ops/`, which provides all three.

### Run the full stack with Docker

The `ops/` directory runs everything end to end — datastores, every service (2× ai/chat
behind Nginx), and the full observability stack:

```bash
cp ops/.env.example ops/.env       # set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 36)
docker compose -f ops/compose.yaml --env-file ops/.env up -d --build
```

See [`ops/README.md`](ops/README.md) for the host-port table, the Grafana dashboards, and
the realtime load test.

### Run locally for development

```bash
pnpm install                        # install the workspace
pnpm --filter @graft/db db:migrate  # run migrations (needs DATABASE_URL)
pnpm dev                            # turbo: run every app in watch mode
```

Each app reads its own environment (see the per-app READMEs). At minimum every backend
service needs `DATABASE_URL`; ai/chat/ingestion also need `REDIS_URL` and the JWT verify
config (`AUTH_JWKS_URL`, `AUTH_ISSUER`, `AUTH_AUDIENCE`); the gateway and ingestion need
`AI_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (base64, 32 bytes).

### Workspace scripts

| Command            | Description                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `pnpm build`       | Build every package and app.      |
| `pnpm dev`         | Run every app in watch mode.      |
| `pnpm lint`        | ESLint across the workspace.      |
| `pnpm check-types` | `tsc --noEmit` across everything. |
| `pnpm format`      | Prettier write.                   |

## API reference

Authenticated calls carry a bearer JWT minted from `GET /api/auth/token` (dashboard) or
are scoped by the widget embed token. Owner-only routes require the `OWNER` role. Every
service also exposes `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz`, and `GET /metrics` (Prometheus).
